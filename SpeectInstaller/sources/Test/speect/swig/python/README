===========================
Speect Python client/server
===========================

A simple Python client/server for Speect voices.


Operation
=========

The server (``server.py``) initializes Speect and loads voices specified
in a configuration file (an example can be found in ``server.conf.example``).
The server serves all synthesis requests and logs all activity to a log
file. The client (``client.py``) can make synthesis requests or request
a list of loaded voices (names to be used when making synthesis
requests) from the server.


Running
=======

Available options and usage information can be found by executing::

    ./server.py --help

or::

     ./client.py --help

The ``VOICENAME`` is any of the names returned when requesting a 
``voicelist`` from the server


Shutting down
=============

The server is shut down by sending a ``SIGINT`` (CTRL-C) signal
to the process.
